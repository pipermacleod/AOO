- Made the "Oaks" storage fire proof

- New Miner works basically the same but Requires there be Stone nearby to operate.
- New Butcher table:  Harvesting AOO Wild animals is no longer required. When a wild AOO animal dies there will be a carcass that you can pick up. you place the carcass on the butcher table  to get all of it resources.

NOTE: In Order to use an existing save you MUST remove all Autominers,Butcher Tables and Juice/Soda dispensers from your game!




A6.1

- If you have 5k Dukes you can now ask the trader to reset the Chamber Below him!
- Fish!   you can now find Fish in Water!   Stun them with a weapon and then loot them to get a spawnable version that you can put in your own private pond/aquarium!  (Net yet able to be used for food)
- Added Military APC and Apache Helicopter that with working Weapons!
- Made Air Drops GOOD!!
-Adjusted the way Oblivion crates Spawn Enemies,  Different enemies and possibly even an npc for you to hire!  IF they spawn something then Crate is destroyed.... no loot for you!
- you no longer get as many vehicle tokens for trading in Rickshaws. you now get 1 token for every pair of rickshaws you trade in.  (It was way to easy to get a RW vehicle too early)  this is just the first change to see how it makes a difference.  Vehicle cost may need to also go up.
